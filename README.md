## Background
And so there's a reason why people would want to download videos from this site. Oftentimes, videos are being downloaded through external websites and sometimes through apps. 

However, there's a problem with the former. While several of these sites have too many ads, there are also a good number that have been 'hacked' in such a way that the user gets tricked to open a malicious or clickbait site, with the website owners not possibly being able to fix it. 

And so: here comes DownYouNow. 

## What it does
DownYouNow is a simple YouTube downloader powered by powered by `YouTube-DL` and `yt_dlp`. 

Pass on a URL, set some output settings, and click the "Run" button beside it — it's that easy but detailed! And, after a few moments, your file will automatically get downloaded. 

And best of all: you'll have a private server for that. That means there'll be no ads and no spying. _And this is due to the app being hosted in Google CoLab; however, these servers will automatically get regenerated every few hours._ 

## Re. Copyright
Just like any other YouTube downloader website or software, DownYouNow is only a medium. It only downloads and processes the video that you, the user, inputs; afterwards, they are deleted from the server. This means that this program can not host any illegal material. **If you are caught downloading illegal material from YouTube, you can not blame this app; kindly check the codes out for proof.**

Furthermore, all files hosted on YouTube belong to their respective owners. We respect their rights.
